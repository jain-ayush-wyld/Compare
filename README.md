Comparing Files
I have created an application which takes input of 2 text files and compares them. It matches the content of the older file with the newer one and arranges its contents accordingly. The contents which are not present in the respective file is printed in upper case. 

I have attached python files(finals.py and selector.py) which I used for comparing txt files. 'selector.py' is the main file.
Using py-to-exe I converted selector.py to independent executable file which can run on any system without the need of python in it.
Kindly download the rest 17 files in a folder and then run "selector.exe" file (application file).
